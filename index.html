                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p class="lead">I am a Brigham Young University student studying to be a Global Supply Chain Managment Major. I am an Eagle Scout and have served a two year Latter Day Saint Mission learning the skills of leadership, hardwork, cooperation, communication, problem solving, and critical thinking. I have worked different jobs throughout the years with companies in different parts thier journey. I have worked with Sports Den in Salt Lake City where I helped design and make shirts for different teams across the state of Utah. I was able to learn many valuable skills that have benefited me in my life. I have also worked at a buisness as it was starting called Smashit Rage Rooms in Salt Lake City Utah. I was a customer service representative here and was able to help guide and provide a better expierence. This helped me be better at helping provide a positive expierence for many different types of customers. Now I am currently working at the Missionary Training Center as a maintnance technician. Here I have learned many tangible skills and some that are less tangible as well. I have learned critical thinking and leadership as I have learned to fix things and as I have mentored newer people I have been able to sharpen and grow my leadership skills. Another facet where I was able to use leadership and mentor and help others was when I was a captain on my highschool tennis team. I was able to learn patience and compassion as I taught and helped them grow into the best that they could be. This also taught me determination as when I started on the team I was one of the worst and I was able to grow through hard work to be one of the best by my final year. It taught me how to be a better person and grow. This skill has benefited me throughout my life as determination can help in all assets of life. I have also learned many skills as I was in my schools student government. This helped me learn a lot about cooperationa and collaboration. Which have been very valuable skills as working with others will always be a part of life.</p>
